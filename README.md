# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data
In this project I will work with [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/) data which contains demographic information about different countries in the world. The data is stored in a database, which can be cloned from a [public repository](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases). SQL will be used to interface with the database to do some preliminary EDA by querying data relevant to various questions of interest.

# Libraries used
